The main code was written by Mike Spivey.

To compile, run
ghc Fun -main-is Fun

To have a first try,
./Fun examples.fun

To get a nice command line, use
rlwrap ./Fun examples.fun


To try the lexer/parser separately, use e.g.

ghci FunParser
lex_string lexer 1 "interval(a,b);;"
parse funParser "interval(a,b);;"
